#  Medicine Recommendation System

An intelligent machine learning-based system that provides personalized medicine recommendations based on patient symptoms, medical history, and drug interactions. This system helps healthcare professionals make informed decisions while ensuring patient safety.

##  Features

- **Symptom Analysis**: Input multiple symptoms for comprehensive analysis
- **Personalized Recommendations**: ML-driven medicine suggestions based on patient profile
- **Drug Interaction Checker**: Identifies potential harmful drug combinations
- **Dosage Recommendations**: Suggests appropriate dosages based on patient factors
- **Alternative Medicine Suggestions**: Provides substitute options when primary choice unavailable
- **Medical History Integration**: Considers past treatments and allergies
- **Confidence Scoring**: Shows prediction confidence for each recommendation
- **Safety Warnings**: Alerts for contraindications and side effects

##  Usage

### Command Line Interface
```python
from medicine_recommender import MedicineRecommender

# Initialize the system
recommender = MedicineRecommender()

# Get recommendations
symptoms = ["fever", "headache", "cough"]
patient_info = {
    "age": 30,
    "weight": 70,
    "allergies": ["penicillin"],
    "current_medications": []
}

recommendations = recommender.recommend(symptoms, patient_info)
print(recommendations)
```


##  Model Architecture

### Data Preprocessing
- **Symptom Encoding**: Convert text symptoms to numerical features
- **Patient Vectorization**: Encode patient demographics and history
- **Drug Feature Extraction**: Extract relevant medicine properties

### Machine Learning Pipeline
1. **Feature Selection**: Identify most relevant symptoms and patient factors
2. **Model Training**: Train ensemble of ML algorithms
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize model parameters
4. **Cross-Validation**: Ensure model generalization
5. **Model Evaluation**: Performance testing on validation set

### Safety Mechanisms
- **Drug Interaction Database**: Check for harmful combinations
- **Contraindication Rules**: Age, pregnancy, and condition-specific restrictions
- **Dosage Calculations**: Weight and age-adjusted recommendations

##  Results & Insights

### Key Findings
- **Most Predictive Symptoms**: [List top symptoms that drive recommendations]
- **Common Medicine Categories**: Pain relievers, antibiotics, anti-inflammatory
- **Patient Factor Importance**: Age and weight significantly impact recommendations

### Model Interpretability
- **Feature Importance**: Shows which symptoms most influence recommendations
- **Decision Trees**: Visualizable decision paths for transparency
- **Confidence Intervals**: Reliability measures for each prediction
